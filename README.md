## Introduction

Software testing is a critical phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to ensure that the application meets its requirements and works as expected. The primary goals of testing include:

- Identifying and fixing bugs.
- Validating functionality.
- Improving the software’s reliability and performance.

This repository includes examples and templates for manual and automated testing, focusing on:

- Functional Testing
- UI Testing
- API Testing
- Performance Testing

## Testing Methodologies

### Manual Testing
Manual testing involves testing software manually without automation tools. It focuses on user experience and exploratory testing. Key types include:

- Smoke Testing
- Regression Testing
- Exploratory Testing

### Automated Testing
Automated testing involves using scripts and tools to execute test cases. Examples include:

- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- End-to-End Testing

### Types of Testing
- **Black Box Testing**: Testing without knowledge of the internal code structure.
- **White Box Testing**: Testing with full knowledge of the internal code structure.
- **Acceptance Testing**: Ensuring the system meets user requirements.
